## Project

Zine starts from the concept of "self-manufacturing"[^1], which establishes the idea that everyone should have access to understand, reproduce, modify or repair their own machines, in an independent way and as an alternative to the industry and those who adopt the same formulas of consumption, dependence and obsolescence.

Today it is possible to build one's own tools for filmmaking and sound art. Without dependence on the big - and not so big - manufacturers and their restrictions. You have no control over the machines: you don't know what you buy, what it is made of, how it is made, let alone how to fix it, replicate it or adapt it to your needs. Most of the time they are "novelty products" based on trends and fads, and therefore with an expiration date. We need tools with which to establish a long-term relationship.

Another fundamental point is the reuse and adaptation of material, such as "old" television and cinema optics, used audio recorders and the creation of accessories from other objects, such as supports and windshields.

## Web

This website is static and lightweight, which helps to reduce the growing and unnecessary internet consumption[^2]. It only consists of HTML code and a stylesheet; it does not rely on JS or any CMS. It does not track you or collect any data, there are no cookies or pop-ups, no ads or referral links. Our typography prioritizes readability, even for visually impaired readers. The source code is free and available in our repository[^3].

Everything that is part of Zine is created only with free software: the web page itself is created only with a text editor, later processed by Pandoc. The visual elements are made with Inkscape and ImageMagick. All 3D models are designed with FreeCAD.
