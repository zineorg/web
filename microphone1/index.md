These small, high-sensitivity, low-noise stereo microphones are perfect for field recordings. They have an omnidirectional pattern and have a high resistance to interference. They are based on the AOM-5024L electret condenser capsule, plus a 3.5mm Neutrik minijack connector and Mogami W2368 miniature cable with a diameter of only 2mm. The body is printed in recycled PET with carbon fibers and its design always maintains the proper distance between the capsule and the windshield, always keeping an air chamber that significantly reduces the effect of wind on the capsule. Although it is recommended to use them with an audio recorder, they can also be used with any DSLR camera or device that has a 3.5mm audio input with PIP.
