Integrated Disks
----------------


The firmware of integrated SSDs/Disks might request access to your
memory according to SATA specification, so better donâ€™t use them being
plugged to the SATA port, directly. Instead, use them via standard
SATA-to-USB2 adapter, which is not capable of granting direct access to
your memory (DMA). Of course, this will slow down your system.


Integrated Wifi
---------------


Replace wifi cards that run with proprietary firmware. Or even better,
replace cards that run with firmware at all. Use one that has no
firmware, but is driven by the kernel driver only.
