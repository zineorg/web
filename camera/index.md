Zine16 is a project under development. It is a free digital camera compatible with 16mm and 8mm manual lenses. It is based on Magic Lantern[^1], so it starts from a "recycled" camera body, allowing to obtain a real digital negative. It works at 24fps with a shutter of 172.8º. Its sensor size is variable, so it has no restrictions to shoot in almost any aspect ratio ---such as 1.33:1, 1.66:1 or 2:1--- and with almost any optics. It uses two 18650 batteries in series in a small reverse polarity protection circuit based on a mosfet (pfet). It has an active ventilation system using a fan and heat sinks; this system is activated manually.

(Re)uses C-mount[^2] film and television optics, known to be the oldest universal mount still in use. The body is made of recycled reinforced plastic and its grip is made of a recycled wood blend. The design supports the use of a Zacuto LCD viewfinder. Its storage system uses overclocked SD cards, so it is very economical. It is completely designed in FreeCAD. It does not record sound, nor does it allow the use of external monitors or proprietary batteries. It does not support autofocus optics, nor stabilizer.
