### Colorista de Vitalina Varela, Gonçalo Ferreira:

---Hi, here is the US trailer for a film I graded last summer, Pedro Costa's "Vitalina Varela".
Its getting a US and Euro release this month, after screening several festivals all over the world. Winning among others, Locarno 2019 for Best Film and Best Actress. Shot on Alexa Mini and graded on Resolve 15. 

---We did a lot of work with secondaries but nothing to crazy, the usual for any other project I guess... I believe we don't have any keying so most of the elements isolation is done trough power windows / masking. They did an incredible job on set so the film was already looking great before hand. Ne Change Rien and Sweet Exorcist were graded on a Baselight. Horse Money and Vitalina were graded on Resolve. In between we did his other films as restorations like "O Sangue Blood" and "Casa de Lava" both released on Second Run... Some were graded on Baselight others on Resolve.
As for Vitalina, I set up my station and monitor (Sony PVM A250) at Pedro's office and it became our grading room.
They used a stock Arri log to 709 Lut for camera display. We then used a costume gamma curve for the grading and we worked from that.
After we were happy with what we had on with the Sony we moved the project to Irmã Lucia post house in Lisbon and we did a final pass on a DCI complient projector. They did the dcp over there and shipped it straight to Locarno.
The big diference between Ne Change Rien and Vitalina is that we kept in touch, we discussed before and during the shooting...even went on set to give additional input on a very specific shot. Pedro would send me some frames, clips, paintings, ideas...I remember we exchanged some moonlight phone shots on whats app. "Could it work this dark?"
He likes strong contrast and needed the film to be really, really dark. So that was the challenge.
I think we nailed it but Leonardo and Pedro did a fantastic job on set.
