High sensitivity and low noise microphones with aluminum body. They are based on Primo's EM272Z1 capsule and their design is modular thanks to their miniXLR connector, as they can be used either on a mini-jack input via PIP or on a balanced XLR input ---thanks to SimpleP48---, only depending on the cable connected to them. Their design is based on an aluminum tube and their manufacture can be done entirely with hand tools. This aluminum body allows them to be used with more efficient accessories, such as loops, mini-blimps and self-made windscreens that you will find in the *accessories* section. They use a top quality Mogami miniature cable, with braided shielding in a very small diameter.
