A geophone is a device used to capture sounds that are uncommon or difficult to obtain with conventional microphones. These transducers consist of a mass suspended on a spring, which converts vibrations into electrical signals; these are recorded and processed by audio recording equipment as low frequency sounds, even very low frequency sounds. Thanks to its high sensitivity, it can capture even very small vibrations: electrical appliances, road traffic, urban structures, water flows, beehives and anthills, musical instruments and even the movement of the soil inside trees.

In geophysics they are used to detect and record ground vibrations or movements. These vibrations can be generated by a variety of sources, such as earthquakes, explosions, heavy machinery or the movement of subway fluids. They are an essential component of seismographs.

Our design is based on Sensor Nederland's ION SM-6 omnidirectional geophone. It has an impedance of 3500 Ω and a nominal frequency of 14 Hz. Its open circuit sensitivity is 80.0 V/m/s.
